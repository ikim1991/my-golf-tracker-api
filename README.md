# My Golf Tracker Back-end 

### Summary  

As an avid golfer wanting to improve his game, I developed this application to help visualize and keep track of my progress. 

The back-end application is hosted on Heroku using its free-tier plan. This may cause it to take a few seconds to load as the app is put to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.  

The front-end web application is hosted on GitHub using GitHub pages.

The Back-end was built using Express.js and MongoDB on Node.js.  

The Golf Tracker application lets the user log all their rounds by the season. This data is used to keep track of the user's progress and visualizes the data. It displays a summary of the user's info on the side while the main content of the page uses pagination to navigate through 3 figures created using Chart.js.  

A 16:9 aspect ratio resolution is recommended.  
The app is currently not supported on mobile and tablets.  
Minimum screen resolution width of 1024px required.
