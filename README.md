# My Golf Tracker  

### Summary  

As an avid golfer wanting to improve his game, I developed this application to help visualize and keep track of my progress.  

To view the coding documentation for this web application, refer to the link below:  
[Coding Documentation Link](https://ikim1991.github.io/coding-documentation/#/golf-tracker/)  

The application is deployed through GitHub Pages and Heroku. The application can be found in the link below:  
[Production Website Link](https://ikim1991.github.io/my-golf-tracker/)  

The source code for the client side can be found in the link below:  
[Client Side Source Code](https://github.com/ikim1991/my-golf-tracker/)  

The back-end application is hosted on Heroku using its free-tier plan. This may cause the first login to take a few seconds to load as the app is put to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.  

The web application is currently not supported on mobile/tablet.
